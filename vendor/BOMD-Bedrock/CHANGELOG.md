# Changelog

All notable changes to **Bosses of Mass Destruction: Bedrock Edition** are documented in this file.

This project is currently in public beta. Features, compatibility requirements, and internal systems may change between releases.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned

* Continue porting bosses and content from the original Java mod.
* Expand multiplayer and cross-device testing.
* Improve structure-generation reliability.
* Continue performance optimization and combat balancing.
* Resolve issues reported during the first public release.

---

## [1.5.4] — Soul Star Locator Stability

### Fixed

* Fixed repeated `Native setter cannot be assigned null or undefined` warnings during remote Night Lich Tower searches.
* Prevented incomplete candidate coordinates from being passed to native entity queries.
* Added safe horizontal filtering when a candidate's Y coordinate is not yet known.
* Invalid candidate coordinates now exit safely without invoking native queries.

### Changed

* Renamed the native structure command from:

```text
/bomd:locate
```

to:

```text
/bomd:find_structure
```

This avoids a conflict with Minecraft's vanilla `/locate` command.

### Compatibility

The following alternatives remain available:

```text
/scriptevent bomd:locate ...
/function bomd/locate/...
```

### Localization

* Rebuilt all `.lang` files as strict UTF-8.
* Removed byte-order marks, NUL bytes, CRLF line endings, and malformed entries.
* Added validation for control characters and localization syntax.

---

## [1.5.3] — Independent Soul Star Locator

### Added

* Added deterministic Night Lich Tower discovery using the world seed.
* Added temporary remote-region inspection for tower candidates.
* Added biome, terrain, liquid, slope, height, and structure-space validation.
* Added persistent storage for rejected regions and generated towers.
* Added serialization of simultaneous searches to prevent duplicate generation.

### Changed

* The Soul Star no longer requires a Night Lich Tower to have been previously loaded.
* Existing known towers are reused before attempting fallback generation.
* The Soul Star is not consumed while searching or when no valid candidate is found.

### Progression

* Night Lich Towers now store defeated status.
* Defeated towers are ignored by the Soul Star.
* Resetting a tower makes it available again.
* Killing the Night Lich updates both the structure registry and deterministic locator state.

---

## [1.5.2] — Structure Locator and Persistent Registry

### Added

* Added a native custom command for locating registered structures.
* Added coordinate-reporting and teleport modes.
* Added autocomplete for supported structure identifiers.
* Added `/scriptevent` and function-based compatibility alternatives.
* Added a persistent world-level structure registry.

### Supported structures

* Night Lich Tower.
* Nether Gauntlet Arena.

### Structure persistence

* Night Lich Towers are registered when their anchor initializes or loads.
* Nether Gauntlet Arenas are registered through their central rune system.
* Registered positions remain available after chunk unloading and world restarts.
* Nearby duplicate records are merged.
* The registry is limited to 192 records.

### Limitation

Naturally generated structures must enter a loaded chunk at least once before they can be registered through their anchors or arena systems.

---

## [1.5.1] — Nether Gauntlet Movement Correction

### Fixed

* Corrected the vertical reference used by Nether Gauntlet navigation.
* Prevented the boss from slowly rising after activation.

* Reduced excessive vertical wind-up movement.

### Changed

* Reduced the first attack delay from 80 to 50 ticks.
* Increased neutral movement response.
* Increased attack-preparation steering response.
* Improved locked-charge support without allowing mid-attack retargeting.

### Nether Gauntlet

* Migrated punch, swirl punch, laser, and darkness timelines to the hybrid engine.
* Synchronized open-hand and closed-fist collision states.
* Replaced most JavaScript tick comparisons with timeline milestones.
* Retained JavaScript-based OBB, swept collision, eye proxy, and laser raycasts.

### Night Lich

* Migrated comet, missile, phantom, teleport, and rage timelines to the hybrid engine.
* Synchronized physical actions with visual animation states.
* Preserved JavaScript-based teleport calculation, navigation, projectiles, progression, and death handling.

### Compatibility

* Minimum Minecraft Bedrock version: `1.26.30`.
* Script API dependency: `@minecraft/server` `2.9.0-beta`.
* Beta APIs experiment required.
